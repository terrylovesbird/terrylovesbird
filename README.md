# About Me
My love of advanced technology and problem solving led me to earn my CS master degree. 
For now, I have interest and experience in Python and development related roles, 
and if there is a chance I would also like to explore interests in other fields of software engineering. 
My short-term traget is to be a full-time software engineer with solid foundations. 
I am looking forward to continuing my career soon.
